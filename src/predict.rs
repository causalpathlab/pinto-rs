//! `pinto predict` — apply a trained `cage` run to a new sample.
//!
//! What crosses samples is the feature side and the community dictionary; the
//! geometry is local and is rebuilt from the new sample's own coordinates:
//!
//! 1. The new data goes through the same preprocessing as `cage` — coordinates,
//!    batch labels, the cell-cell KNN graph (spatial under `-c`, expression
//!    otherwise) — with the same flags, so the pairs are what `cage` would have
//!    built on this sample.
//! 2. The frozen feature embedding `{model}.feature_embedding.parquet` is aligned
//!    to the new sample's feature axis by name. A feature the model never saw gets
//!    no dictionary row: it is dropped from the partition rather than seeded
//!    (this is inference, not a warm start — inventing a row would let a feature
//!    the model knows nothing about pull on every pair's latent).
//! 3. Every cell pair — and every cell — is placed on that dictionary by the
//!    model's own pair encoder (`{model}.pair_encoder.safetensors`, the map
//!    that placed the training run's pairs), or by the exact per-pair Poisson
//!    MAP when the model has none, giving a pair latent in the trained space.
//! 4. Each pair is assigned to the nearest trained link community by cosine
//!    against the training centroids — the mean L2-normalized pair latent of
//!    each community, recomputed here from `{model}.latent.parquet` and
//!    `{model}.link_community.parquet` so no new artifact is needed.
//! 5. A cell's propensity is its incident-edge fraction per community, exactly
//!    the definition `cage` / `lc` / `dsvd` publish, and the cell embedding is
//!    the cell's own placement from step 3, as `cage` writes it.
//!
//! Outputs mirror `cage`'s inference tables: `{out}.{coord_pairs, latent,
//! link_community, propensity, feature_community, cell_embedding}.parquet` and a
//! `{out}.pinto.json` manifest, so `pinto plot` and `pinto annotate` read a
//! predicted sample as they would a fitted one.
