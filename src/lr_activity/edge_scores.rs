//! Descriptive per-batch LR contact-association scores
//! (`pinto lra --edge-scores-only`).
//!
//! The estimand: the probability that a ligand and a receptor are
//! co-expressed across a physical contact of one link community, BEYOND
//! each side's independent activity. Per (batch, community, pair), every
//! contact contributes both orientations, and each instance is classified
//! by detection at its two endpoints into a 2x2 table:
//!
//! ```text
//!                receptor+ (2nd)   receptor- (2nd)
//! ligand+ (1st)      n11               n10
//! ligand- (1st)      n01               n00
//! ```
//!
//! The score is the posterior log odds ratio under a Jeffreys-style
//! Dirichlet(1/2) prior (the classic +1/2 in every cell), with its
//! posterior standard error:
//!
//! ```text
//! log_or    = ln[(n11+.5)(n00+.5) / ((n10+.5)(n01+.5))]
//! log_or_se = sqrt(1/(n11+.5) + 1/(n10+.5) + 1/(n01+.5) + 1/(n00+.5))
//! ```
//!
//! Both-orientation enumeration transposes the table under a ligand to
//! receptor swap, and the odds ratio is transpose-invariant, so
//! `log_or(L,R) = log_or(R,L)` is structural. The margins ship beside it
//! as `lig_rate` / `rec_rate`: each side's independent activity at these
//! contacts, which the downstream analysis needs as covariates to isolate
//! the interaction, and which are activity phenotypes in their own right.
//!
//! Detection (count > 0) deliberately replaces magnitude: on measured
//! split-half reliability the magnitude-weighted means came out near
//! noise while the detection log-odds held up, raw and with the margins
//! regressed out of both halves (numbers in the local record).
//!
//! Direction is reported as CONFIGURATION, never inferred: the pair
//! file names the ligand, so each physical contact classifies from its
//! four detection facts into one-way (the ligand sits on exactly one
//! side, identifying its carrier cell), mutual (co-detected both ways,
//! no side to name), or silent. Per row that yields `n_oneway`,
//! `n_mutual` (the 2x2's `n11` counts oriented instances, so
//! `n11 = 2*n_mutual + n_oneway`), and `role_purity`, the mean over
//! cells touching a co-detected contact of
//! `|sent - received| / (sent + received)`.
//!
//! Two honesty rules shape the outputs. A PRIOR-DOMINATED pair, with no
//! co-detection observed and less than half a co-detection expected
//! under independence, is NaN in both columns: such a table carries no
//! information about association, and the +1/2 prior alone would
//! otherwise push the estimate toward `ln(2n)` while the SE plateaus
//! instead of growing. And the SE takes the physical contact, not the
//! oriented instance, as its sampling unit; contacts sharing a cell are
//! still correlated, so `log_or_se` is a relative precision weight for
//! filtering and weighting, not a calibrated interval. No thresholds are
//! applied here, by policy.
