//! What a matrix ROW means, resolved once from the row names.
//!
//! A plain matrix has one feature per row. A splice-channelized one (faba's
//! `{feature}/count/{spliced,unspliced}`) has two rows per feature, and reading one
//! as the other is silent rather than loud: `n_features < n_rows` means a per-feature
//! index into a per-row vector never goes out of bounds, it just reads the
//! wrong feature.
//!
//! Consumers split into two kinds, and the split is the whole point:
//!
//! - **Mean FEATURE.** `cage`'s training loop and pseudobulk selection, `lc`'s
//!   projection basis, count filter, dictionary and merge cutoff, and `lra`'s
//!   ligand and receptor lookup. All of these fold through this type.
//! - **Mean ROW.** Anything that reads the matrix directly and reports what it
//!   read: the degree-corrected Poisson refinement's blocking dimension, the
//!   saved per-row NB precisions, `dsvd`'s two stacked channels.
//!
//! The NB-Fisher weights need BOTH, and they are the reason
//! [`Self::broadcast_to_rows`] exists: the weight is a function of abundance
//! and mean and is not additive, so it is evaluated once per feature on folded
//! statistics and then spread back over that feature's rows. Folding the weights
//! afterwards would hand a feature a precision no measurement supports.
//!
//! Resolution is strict by default: a feature axis where only some rows carry
//! splice channels is an error, because pooling a row whose track is unknown
//! has no correct answer. [`FeatureAxis::resolve_or_identity`] is the fallback for
//! a consumer that never pools.
