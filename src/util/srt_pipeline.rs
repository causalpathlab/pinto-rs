//! Shared SRT preprocessing pipeline.
//!
//! `lc`, `dsvd`, and `cage` all share the same opening sequence:
//! load → invariants → spatial-or-expression KNN → optional auto-batch →
//! optional batch effects → optional NB Fisher feature weights.
//! `preprocess_srt` extracts that once.
//!
//! `SrtCellPairs<'a>` borrows the `SparseIoVec` and `Mat`, so this bundle
//! returns the *owned* data + graph, and the caller builds its pairs from
//! `SrtCellPairs::with_graph`, passing the data, coordinates, graph and edge
//! source it finds here.
