//! How `-k` and `--knn-expr` resolve into the two k's the pipeline actually
//! uses, and which combinations are refused.
//!
//! Two flags, two graphs, and the mapping between them depends on whether
//! `--coord` was given. `-k` sizes the BASE graph; `--knn-expr` sizes the
//! expression graph that is unioned into it. Without coordinates there is
//! nothing to union into, so `--knn-expr` sizes the base graph instead and the
//! augmentation is off.
//!
//! The failures these guard are silent ones. A `k` of 0 does not build an empty
//! graph, it floors to 1-NN, which then fragments into hundreds of components
//! and — in expression mode, where component folding is off — hundreds of
//! batches. And a resolution that returned the same number for both roles would
//! union the expression graph with itself.
