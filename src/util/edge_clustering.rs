//! Shared CLI surface for cutting a pair latent into link communities.
//!
//! `cage`, `dsvd` and `prop` all end in the same place: an
//! `[N_pairs × K_latent]` projection that has to become per-edge community
//! labels. They therefore offer the same flags, with the same meanings and the
//! same defaults, and resolve them through the same [`EdgeClustering`] enum
//! that `compute_propensity_and_feature_community_stat` consumes.
