//! Cosine-similarity agglomerative merging over the feature × community
//! dictionary.
//!
//! In `pinto lc`, each fitted link community has a posterior feature-expression
//! profile (the "dictionary atom") produced by `compute_feature_community_stat`.
//! Many fine link communities share a near-identical profile — they encode
//! the same cell type or program sitting at different spatial locations or
//! neighbourhoods. To recover a consistent cell-type-level annotation we
//! collapse such columns by hierarchical agglomerative merging on cosine
//! similarity of per-feature-centred log-rates.
//!
//! The output `Vec<BhcMerge>` reuses the merge-tree node type from
//! `data_beans::alg::bhc` purely as a binary-merge-tree carrier. The
//! cut function is the same union-find walk BHC uses; under the
//! cosine alias, `log_bf` carries cosine similarity and `cutoff` is a
//! user-chosen similarity threshold rather than a Bayes-factor break
//! point.
//!
//! Linkage: average linkage (UPGMA). When two clusters merge, the
//! similarity between the new node and any other cluster `o` is the
//! `n_samples`-weighted mean of `(left, o)` and `(right, o)` similarities,
//! which is equivalent to the average pairwise similarity between leaves.

    // are flat — because they are the LOUDEST rows. A feature with no counts gets a
    // Poisson-Gamma posterior driven entirely by each community's exposure, and
    // `log` of a near-zero rate swings hard between communities, while a
    // well-measured feature's log-rate is stable. Measured, the
    // centred row sum-of-squares was ~13x LARGER for zero-count features than for
    // features seen in >= 20 spots (medians 235 vs 18.5), and
    // `spearman(row SS, nnz) = -0.986`. Cosine is dominated by the
    // largest-magnitude rows, so 19k noise features outvoted 17.7k real ones: 43% of
    // community pairs scored >= 0.9 and the default cut collapsed 50 communities
    // to 4, with 97% of cells in one — a segmentation at chance (1.03x a
    // neighbour-agreement null, against 11.1x before the merge).

    //     features weight exactly 1.0 and well-detected ones a median of 0.878 —
    //     they are built to suppress high-dispersion housekeeping features, which is
    //     the opposite question.
    //   * Filtering on low dictionary variance keeps precisely the noise, per the
    //     inverted correlation above.
    // A mismatched mask would silently score a truncated feature set, which looks
    // like a plausible tree and is not one.
