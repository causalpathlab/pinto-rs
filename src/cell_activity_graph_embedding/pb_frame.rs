//! The PB training frame: everything the SGD needs once the trained
//! unit is a finest-level super-cell (pseudobulk) rather than a cell.
//!
//! Built from arm-independent inputs (the coarsening labels and the
//! pair graph), so both gate modes train the same way; the sampled
//! arm's collapse SVD enters only as the optional warm start, wired in
//! `fit.rs`. Cell-cell edges appear here exactly once, at build time,
//! to be folded into PB-PB super edges; the training loop never sees a
//! cell id again.
