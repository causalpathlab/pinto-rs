//! `pinto cage` — activity-gated cell-graph embedding.
//!
//! Learns per-cell embeddings on the spatial cell-cell graph by visiting
//! each feature: every feature defines a per-cell activity vector that gates a
//! shared multi-scale cell-cell hierarchy. Embedding-only — no count decoder.
//!
//! The cell axis is collapsed into super-cells per coarsening level and one
//! shared SVD basis is fit over them ([`pb_basis`]); that basis warm-starts the
//! trained PB table. Chain levels differ only in their negative pools.
