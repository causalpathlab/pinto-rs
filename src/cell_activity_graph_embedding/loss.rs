//! cage's batched feature-modulated PB-PB chain NCE (no cell is ever
//! scored here: `u`, `v` are finest-level super-cells).
//!
//! Scores `G` independent [`UnitChainBatch`]es — one per feature in the current
//! chunk — in a single forward pass, returning `[G, L]` per-(feature, level)
//! losses. Collapses ~18k tiny device forwards per epoch into ~600 big ones.
//!
//! Per-row score, for feature `g` at chain level `ℓ`:
//!
//! ```text
//! s(u, v) = θ_g · (e_u ⊙ e_v) + b_u + b_v
//! θ_g     = z_g ⊙ e_feature[g]     z ~ Bern(pip), redrawn once per EPOCH
//! ```
//!
//! `e_u ⊙ e_v` is the EDGE embedding: the pair's participation in each latent
//! community, high only when both endpoints load on it. So the score asks
//! whether `u` and `v` agree under a per-feature diagonal metric — an adjacency
//! statistic — where the rank-1 form it replaced scored any two cells lying
//! along `θ_g`, adjacent or not.
//!
//! cage's own loss: geu's chain module scores a rank-1 quadratic form and
//! has no feature-modulated variant left. The per-edge NCE itself is geu's, and
//! selectable — see [`NceObjective`] and `--nce-objective`.
