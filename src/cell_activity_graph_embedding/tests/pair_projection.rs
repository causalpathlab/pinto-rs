//! The pair projection solves a known problem: with the dictionary frozen and the
//! counts generated from a known `e_uv`, the MAP is that `e_uv`. These tests
//! generate exactly that and check the exact solver lands on it — from the
//! origin and from a warm start — plus the two properties the design rests on:
//! `β_uv` absorbs pooled depth, and a pair with no counts stays at the origin
//! rather than being handed a fabricated direction.
