//! Per-pair Poisson-MAP projection onto cage's frozen feature embedding.
//!
//! cage trains cells and features into one shared `D`-dim space by predicting
//! spatial adjacency. What the rest of pinto consumes, though, is a *pair*
//! latent: `lc` / `dsvd` cluster cell pairs into link communities and derive a
//! cell's propensity from the mix its incident edges carry. This module
//! produces that pair latent the same way `senna bge` / `senna gem` produce a
//! cell latent in phase 2 — freeze the feature side, re-estimate each node
//! against its own counts.
//!
//! The node here is the pair, and its observation is the POOLED count
//! `n_uv,g = x_gu + x_gv`: Poisson-exact (a sum of Poissons is Poisson), and it
//! puts a pair that straddles a boundary *between* the two programs it pools
//! rather than on either one — which is what earns interface edges their own
//! cluster without an explicit difference channel.
//!
//! ```text
//! s_uv,g = ⟨e_g, e_uv⟩ + b_g + β_uv
//! μ_uv,g = exp(s_uv,g)
//! L      = Σ_{g ∈ G} μ_uv,g  −  Σ_g n_uv,g · s_uv,g  +  (λ/2)‖e_uv‖²
//! ```
//!
//! - `e_g` is cage's trained `e_feat` row, **frozen**. That is what makes the
//!   problem identified: the basis is pinned by the dictionary, so the `O(D)`
//!   rotation freedom that sank the free-edge-embedding experiment cannot
//!   exist here, and the objective (Poisson NLL + ridge) is strictly convex in
//!   `e_uv`.
//! - `b_g` is the **empirical** log feature abundance, not cage's `b_feat`. The
//!   trained feature bias came out of a logistic NCE and is a graph-popularity
//!   term, not a log-rate; this likelihood needs a log-rate. Fixing `b_g` to
//!   data also closes the gauge freedom geu's phase 2 has to correct for
//!   (`θ ← θ − v`, `b_g ← b_g + ⟨e_g, v⟩` leaves every score identical *only*
//!   when `b_g` is free to absorb the shift) — so no gauge fix is needed here,
//!   and `θ = 0` means "composition equal to the population average" rather
//!   than an arbitrary corner of the space.
//! - `β_uv` is a free scalar per pair. It absorbs the pooled library size, so
//!   `e_uv` carries composition only — the job `b_cell` does in bge/gem phase 2
//!   ("always fitted … keeping `e_c` depth-corrected"). With `β_uv` free the
//!   Poisson MAP *is* the multinomial MAP over the pair's feature composition.
//!
//! # How it is solved
//!
//! The encoder ([`encoder`]) amortizes it: a shared trunk reads each
//! endpoint's sufficient statistic — the counts enter the objective only
//! through `Σ_g n_g e_g`, `N` and `Σ_g n_g b_g`, three sparse sums — into a
//! cell code and a small gated mixture turns two codes into the pair code,
//! trained on this same likelihood and run once over every pair on the
//! device. Per node the
//! problem is `D+1` parameters and strictly convex, so the exact solver is
//! Newton with the partition summed over the active axis
//! ([`newton_polish`]): the check the encoder is held to on a seeded sample
//! after every fit, and the finisher for the few placements whose certificate
//! puts them far from the optimum.
//!
//! Two things keep a solve cheap:
//!
//! 1. **`β_uv` is profiled out, not descended.** Given `e_uv`, the optimal
//!    intercept is closed-form (`Σ_g μ_g = N_uv`), so it is solved exactly each
//!    step and never enters the Newton system — and by the envelope theorem
//!    the gradient of the profile objective is just the full gradient evaluated
//!    there, so this costs nothing in correctness. What is left is the
//!    multinomial gradient
//!    `N_uv · (predicted composition mean − observed composition mean) + λ e_uv`
//!    and its Hessian `N_uv · Cov_p(e) + λI`, which need no partition *value*,
//!    only normalized weights — so nothing overflows and the ridge is the only
//!    thing setting scale.
//! 2. **The data term is a constant.** `Σ_g n_uv,g · e_g` is linear in the
//!    parameters, so it is computed once per node and never re-derived inside
//!    the loop.
//!
//! # Why not geu's block SGD
//!
//! `graph-embedding-util`'s `fit::projection::block_sgd` already generalizes
//! "frozen dictionary, per-node Poisson-MAP" over two node types (cells,
//! pseudobulks) and sums the partition exactly, as one side of a matmul it is
//! computing anyway. A pair is a third node type, so the obvious question is
//! why it isn't fed to that engine. Three reasons, in order of how binding they
//! are:
//!
//! - Its entry point is `pub(crate)`, and its batch divisor is wired to bge /
//!   gem's pseudobulk hierarchy (the per-batch feature fold `δ` indexed by each cell's batch), which a
//!   spatial pair — batch-divided per endpoint, before pooling — does not have.
//!   Reaching it means widening another crate's API and generalizing that
//!   abstraction for one caller.
//! - It is candle/`Device`-coupled, and each pair is `D+1` parameters — the
//!   arithmetic is nowhere near GEMM-shaped per node.
//! - The profiled intercept above removes the reason to form the partition
//!   *value* at all: the gradient and the Hessian need normalized weights, and
//!   a `D × D` Newton step per node is what a strictly convex `D+1`-parameter
//!   problem calls for — a saving a block-SGD engine has no way to express.
//!
//! If a second caller ever wants this, the right move is to lift the solver,
//! not to widen the engine — the per-node loop below has no pair-specific
//! arithmetic in it.
