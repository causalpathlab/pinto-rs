//! Pseudobulk basis for `pinto cage`: super-cell counts per coarsening level,
//! and one shared SVD over them.
//!
//! ```text
//! collapse cells -> super-cell counts Y[g,p]      (coarsening gives the groups)
//! one shared SVD -> e_pb_svd, a D-dim super-cell side
//! ```
//!
//! Coarsening already defines the pseudobulks (`ml.all_cell_labels` IS the
//! cell->super-cell map) and collapsing counts against it is one call to
//! [`coarsen_cell_expression_dense`]. Neither is reimplemented here. What
//! coarsening does NOT produce is `e_pb_svd`: the super-cells expressed in the
//! same `D` dims the feature loadings live in. It hands over labels and a
//! `proj_dim` RANDOM projection; neither is that.
//!
//! The finest level's basis is the WARM START of the trained PB table, and it
//! is exported per cell as `pseudobulk_cells.parquet` so the basis can be
//! inspected as a UMAP and as a spatial map before anything is built on it.
//!
//! # Why super-cells rather than single spots
//!
//! A single spot detects only a small fraction of the feature axis, so a zero is
//! mostly non-detection. Super-cells aggregate tens of spots, so a zero means
//! closer to absent.
//!
//! Every coarsening level contributes. The basis is fit ONCE and shared: a
//! per-level SVD would give per-level directions, so a coordinate would mean a
//! different thing at each level and the shared `D` this design rests on would
//! be fiction.
