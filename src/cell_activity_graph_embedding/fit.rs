//! `pinto cage` entrypoint: activity-gated cell-graph embedding.
//!
//! Learns a per-SUPER-CELL (pseudobulk, PB) embedding `e_pb [P x D]` by
//! contrastive (NCE) prediction of PB-PB adjacency, one feature at a time. No
//! cell and no cell-cell pair is ever trained on: cells enter once, when
//! their spatial KNN edges are folded into PB super edges, and reappear only
//! in evaluation readouts (the per-pair latent, the propensity, and each
//! cell's own placement by the pair encoder).
//!
//! ```text
//! load -> spatial KNN -> batch effects                  util::srt_pipeline
//! HVG-weighted projection -> graph_coarsen_multilevel   nested super-cell levels
//! build_feature_active_fine_edges                          per-feature activity, active edges
//! collapse + SVD                                        pb_basis -> warm start of e_pb

//!
//! # What the training loop optimizes
//!
//! Positives are PB-PB SUPER EDGES at the finest coarsening level:
//! cell-cell spatial KNN edges folded by endpoint labels, each carrying
//! the summed per-feature activity of the fine edges inside it. Negatives
//! are sibling PBs drawn per chain level: at level `l` a negative sits
//! in a different super-cell at `l` but the SAME parent at `l-1`, so the
//! contrast sharpens with depth. The coarsening hierarchy is live in
//! every step, one level up from where it used to be. There is one
//! trained embedding, over finest-level PBs; the collapse SVD is its
//! warm start.
//!
//! ```text
//! s(P,Q) = theta_g . (e_P (*) e_Q) + b_P + b_Q
//! theta_g = e_feat[g]
//! ```
//!
//! `e_P (*) e_Q` is the SUPER-EDGE embedding: the pair's joint
//! participation in each latent community, high only when both endpoint
//! PBs load on it.
//!
//! A per-(feature, dim) feature gate on `theta_g` — first a learned
//! spike-and-slab, then a Gibbs-sampled per-epoch mask — was carried here and
//! removed with the rest of the workspace's gate machinery; the measurement
//! history is in `plans/posterior-feature-gate.md`.
